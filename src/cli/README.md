# pongccheatscli
This is a cheating component. It is not designed to replace pongccheatsd; rather, it is designed as an alternative for quick-and-dirty use cases. It is not very stable and is best used as a reference.

# Requirements
* Linux
* gcc
* pidof
* Access to /proc/*/maps for Pong C
* Needs to be able to use ptrace on Pong C, usually means you must run as root

# start
Run `start.sh` with no parameters for usage information.

# Documentation
